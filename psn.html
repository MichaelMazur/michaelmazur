                <p>
                    Personalization was a big bet for Away Travel in late 2018 through 2019. We were tasked with providing customers a way to personalize luggage, bags, and soft goods on the website. A standalone experience was required along with the ability to monogram in cart as well.

               The project was on a two month long timeline. My role was lead designer, working alongside a design manager, product manager, project manager, and an engineering team of two. We delivered a new cart experience, and personalization flow which had separate layouts for desktop and mobile.

                <p>
                    We knew a project of this complexity would be a large undertaking due to design and engineering debt we accrued over time. We decided to invest in a two week discovery period to better understand all use cases, and potential problem areas. In that time, we found that there were many complexities with creating ideal user flows with existing designs.

            <div class="col-md-5 margin-top-70">
            <p>
                
              Prior to the discovery phase, two other team members were working on customer research.  We found that customers thought about the personalization process as a final step in purchasing their luggage. Based on these findings, we found that our current PDP and cart designs were problematic.

                    After a thorough discovery phase, we pitched multiple solutions in varying levels of effort. Due to business goals, and scheduled press we were given a two month window to flesh out and build all the necessary pages to release an ideal user experience.

             With that in mind we decided to ambitiously tackle a stand alone desktop experience, in cart desktop functionality, mobile stand alone experience, mobile in cart functionality, and a new full page cart. We knew customers were going to have a lot of customizable options so we decided to ship a completely different personalization mobile experience.

                    Working with the product management, and engineering teams I  set out to design a new full page cart experience. Working together we put together a competitive analysis, and functional requirements document. Since we already had the functionality to monogram a luggage tag in cart  I had to come up with an interim solution before we shipped the full personalization

              experience across multiple products. Along with shipping the new cart I worked on  adjusting our design language to be ADA complaint. The process was very much iterative and resulted in a successful launch of the cart that was ADA complaint. The new design doubled our add to carts for “add-on” products.

                    Next we had to tackle the actual personalization process. I had a good head start on desktop from the initial discovery phase. I worked out the additional edge cases on Desktop and skinned the designs. After exploring several design paradigms I landed on a scalable design for mobile that could grow with forthcoming future product offerings.

                    We found that there were several main use cases that we needed to account for. User personalizing from the PDP, user personalizing from the cart, and the respective mobile flows. On mobile there were some implications for products that didn't have multiple personalization offerings.

                    Communication of pricing became tricky for this project. The copy team felt strongly about communicating pricing in the initial link however we were had our suspicions that this was not the best way to approach the problem. We went back and forth with a few teams, and decided we need to do some user testing to inform our decision making process.

                We needed to act quickly as some deadlines were coming, so we decided to do some store intercepts. We had the sales team divert customers to us that were looking to make a purchase, in return they would receive a gift card for 15-30 minute of their time. Two rounds of user testing were conducted with 13 users, and a total of 3 designs were used.

                    The first test quickly gave us the feedback that we needed after 3 interviews. We decided to come up with a couple of solutions to the problems the users reported. We had to address the fact that we were advertising a low price but defaulting to the higher priced item for suitcases. We also realized including

                    a ‘+’ in the call out for pricing was confusing to users once they saw the final price in the CTA at the end of their personalization process. We solved this problem by calling out the price without a ‘+’, including a summary at the end of the process when entering the flow from the PDP, and showing a total price in the add to cart CTA.
